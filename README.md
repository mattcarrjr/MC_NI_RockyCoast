# Rocky Coast Video Directions
## Version 01: PS1 Future Fantasy Cut Scene (Loose Narrative)
This version of the video is inspired by late 1990's video games, most notably 
Final Fantasy 7.  There is a loose narrative around a rag tag group of scrappy 
steampunk-inspired heroes who travel the world in a floating airship.
An ancient rock monster is awakened from a deep slumber from its under sea lair,
And begins its slow journey towards a futuristic city, fully intending to destroy it.
Our heroes race to stop the monster, with the video culminating in a cosmic explosion that hurtles all involved through space and time to a place where nature has
conquered all and the future city is overrun by lush vegetation and the encroaching sea.

This vision for the video will be executed using primitive 3D animation 
and "Chibi" style characters (blocky characters with generalized features)for our main protagonists.  Objects and textures will 
be rendered with simplistic designs to give a retro Playstation feel, while maintaining a cinematic feel to the scene shots and pacing

The story will not be spelled out for the audience and will therefore have a bit of an abstract yet familiar feel.  

While this version has A LOT of fun potential, it has more of a chance of running slightly over our set date of April 20.  However the payoff for this video could have
more of an impact.

## Version 02: Abstract/Impressionist CG/Footage
This version of the video will be more abstract and impressionistic, 
relying on a combo of higher fidelity CG animation devoid of characters, 
live action footage of nature scenes, and glitch art to treat footage and aid 
with transitions.  Shots will be superimposed on each other at times, giving the 
video more of a collage effect.
The CG sections will be in a more "motion graphics" bent, relying more of objects 
rotating around each other, and/or more static scenes being shot from 
different angles.  
We can think of these more as a series of "still life" images with a subtle amount 
of movement, like water lapping against rocks,
boulders slowly rotating around gemstones, 
structures emerging from earth and floating in space, etc.
The live-action footage will be treated as well to give it more worn VHS style to help 
contrast with some of the more clinical CG shots.
We can sprinkle in some AI imagery in here as well.

## Version 03: Abstract 2D/3D Motion Graphics and Illustrations
In this version we can focus only on abstract 2D shape and color combinations.
The motion will be synchronized to the music.
This effect, while relatively simple, can be effective in showing hypnotic rhythmic repetition.
This could work nicely with the idea of meditation reflected in the songs lyrics.
This could translate into 3D animation as well.
We can sprinkle in some AI imagery in here as well.
Illustration can also be used along with some glitch processes to create textures
and distorted imagery.
